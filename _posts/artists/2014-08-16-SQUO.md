SQUO became a musician at a very early age. From the age of 7 he was classically trained in piano, building the base of theory knowledge he needed to succeed later in his career. His DJ & Production career began in 2009, and he realized his dream of bringing awe inspiring electronic music to the world. Now, as Co-Owner of Wild Jokers, LLC, with new music in the works, & exciting things happening every day, things can only grow further for SQUO. WILD JOKERS RADIO airs weekly on an ongoing basis on 90.3 WVPH FM & streaming live on wearewildjokers.com, Sundays 4-6pm. Look for more to come from this budding artist!
